# News Site

We where asked to make a News Site with basic css3 and html5.

## The problem

This i sthe first real challenge on this bootcamp since I don't have any idea of coding. I read the material and use chatGTP to help me with the articles text.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
