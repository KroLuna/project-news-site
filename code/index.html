                <p style="margin-left:50px;">A Siberian husky named Luna is being hailed as a hero after she rescued a lost hiker in the Sierra Nevada mountains on Saturday.

                The hiker, 25-year-old John Doe, was hiking alone when he got lost in a snowstorm. He was wandering around for hours, when he came across Luna.
                
                Luna was a stray husky who had been living in the mountains for several months. She had been rescued by a local animal shelter just a few weeks earlier.
                
                Doe was exhausted and cold, and he was about to give up hope when he saw Luna. She ran up to him and started licking his face. Doe knew that she was trying to help him, so he followed her.
                
                Luna led Doe back to the trail, and he was able to find his way back to safety. Doe said that he was so grateful to Luna for saving his life.
