        <img src="./images/husky.jpg" alt="Picture of a husky" />

        <p>
          A Siberian husky named Luna is being hailed as a hero after she
          rescued a lost hiker in the Sierra Nevada mountains on Saturday. The
          hiker, 25-year-old John Doe, was hiking alone when he got lost in a
          snowstorm. He was wandering around for hours, when he came across
          Luna. Luna was a stray husky who had been living in the mountains for
          several months. Doe was exhausted and cold, and he was about to give
          up hope when he saw Luna. Doe knew that she was trying to help him, so
          he followed her. Luna led Doe back to the trail, and he was able to
          find his way back to safety. Doe said that he was so grateful to Luna
          for saving his life.

          <h4>The Future of Electricity.</h4>
          <p>
            One promising area of research is the development of renewable

          <p>
            In today's digital age, it's more important than ever to make time
            for reading. With so many screens vying for our attention, it can be
            easy to forget the simple pleasure of curling up with a good book.
            But reading offers a number of benefits that screen time simply
            can't match.
